This example works as the previous one if the open in read-final.c is called with the flag O_NONBLOCKING. However, if the flag O_NONBLOCKING is not set, a blocking behaviour should be noticed. 

It is not possible to call 

	./read

before

	./write

as the former will block until some data are available to be read.
